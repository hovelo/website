		<h2 class="meta">Hovélo is a group of friendly riders out to explore the Sussex countryside and to have&nbsp;fun.</h2>
		<p>If you’d like to ride with us, we’d love to see you for an <strong>8am</strong> start every <strong>Sunday</strong> at the <strong><a href="https://www.smallbatchcoffeeroasters.co.uk/blogs/locations/goldstone-villas">Goldstone Villas</a> Small Batch&nbsp;Coffee&nbsp;Company</strong>.</p>
		<p>Make sure you check out the <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/94708/discussion">Strava Discussions</a> to see what's happening.</p>

		<h2>What is Hovélo?</h2>
		<p>Unlike other cycling clubs, Hovélo has no membership fees, no committee meetings, no racing and no-one in charge. Our aim is to turn up on Sunday and ride through the Sussex countryside.</p>
		<p>We are a friendly and informal group of road cyclists. The age and ability varies massively and we're ultimately about enjoying a beautiful weekend ride.</p>
		<p>Hovélo is open to everyone but you'll need to be comfortable riding at an average speed (including climbs...and there are some) of 14 - 19mph (22 - 30 kmph).</p>
		<p>Rides aren't led like a traditional cycling club, but decided on the day (or a few days before on Slack) by who turns up and how they're feeling. The speed is determined by the riders too, plus, we don’t drop anybody. Our ride lengths van vary between 30 - 60 miles (45 - 100km) depending on who is riding and when they need to be back by.</p>
		<p>This isn't about tearing people's legs off or suffering - you can find that elsewhere. This is about getting used to riding in a group and having fun. There'll be chatting, jokes and discussions about cycling etiquette (and maybe a post-ride beer or coffee).</p>
		<p>Shaved legs entirely optional for both sexes.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="subtle wrap">
		<div class="map" id="js-map"></div>

		<h2>Routes</h2>
		<p>Hovélo rides can be spontaneous or they can be planned beforehand. We have a few "old faithfuls" we rely on, but we might sometimes put a new spin on one (a different road or direction)
	</section>

	<section class="wrap">
		<h2>How do I Join?</h2>
		<p><b>You simply turn up at <strong>8am</strong> outside outside the Goldstone Villas Small Batch Coffee Company with your bike</b>. We will often have a pre-ride coffee and a chat before heading out.</p>
		<p>If it's your first ride with us, make sure you sign up to our <a href="https://slack.hovelo.co.uk/invite">Slack group</a> (or post a note on <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/94708/discussion" rel="nofollow">Strava</a>) and introduce yourself - that way we can make sure someone is there to welcome you and show you the ropes!</p>

			<h2>Slack</h2>
			<p>We organise rides & meetups via the Slack group. You don't have to have been out with us to join, so sign up, say hello and organise your first ride!</p>

		<h2>What should I bring?</h2>
		<p>Although there will be people to help, you should be prepared for any eventuality. Make sure you have a <b>pump</b> and <b>spare inner tube</b> with you to fix that puncture, and plenty of <b>water</b> and <b>food</b> (such as energy bars) to keep you going.</p> Most importantly, bring along a <b>good sense of humour</b>!
